  <p>This page serves as a centralized list of links to my own open-source software projects.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Please note that although each project has its own individual page, I have yet to write specific description content for these webpages.</p>
  <p>For the time being, the GitHub repositories for each project (linked in the <strong>"Branch"</strong> column) are the best source of information in this regard.</p>
  <p>If you have any additional questions, please feel free to use the form on my <a href="{{ site.permalink_contact }}"><strong>Contact</strong></a> page.</p>

  <h2>Thank you for your patience!</h2>
