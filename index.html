<h1>Graduate School Applications</h1>
<p>I recently applied to several Ph.D. programs, with the goal of studying Computational Materials Science beginning in the Fall 2021 semester.</p>
<p>If you are visiting this site as a part of reviewing my application to your school, you may find my <a href="/about/"><strong>About</strong></a> and <a href="/portfolio/"><strong>Portfolio</strong></a> pages to be especially helpful.</p>
